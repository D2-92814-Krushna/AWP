        <h4><b><u><center>Building the Document Structure</center></u></b></h4>

        The two primary sections of an HTML documents are :
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>HEAD </b>
            </li>
            <ul type ="square">
                <li>
                    The <i><b>Title</b> </i> tag in HEAD section gives the title to the Page
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>BODY</b></li>
            <ul type ="square">
                <li>
                    Whatever is written in the BODY tag appears on the browser window.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unordered lists can be created using the <b><i>ul</i></b> tag followed by <b><i>li</i></b>  tags that list out the bulleted text. Li 
tag can have the attribute, <b><i>type = circle</i></b> or <b><i>disc or square</i></b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ordered lists are created using the <b><i>ol</i></b> tag followed by <b><i>li</i></b> tags 
that can have the attribute <b><i>type = 1</i></b> or <b><i>1</i></b> or <b>A</b> or <b>I</b>     
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>
In addition to lists, the text can be “physically formatted” to appear 
either <b>bold</b> or italicized or <u>underlined</u> or <strike>strike through</strike> or it could also be <sub>subscripted</sub> or <sup>superscripted</sup> depending 
upon the need of the creator. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The text can be made to appear more attractive using fonts of various styles. The font 
tag does this job. The <b><i>face</i></b> attribute can change the font style to whichever it is equated to. The size attribute will 
change the font size which can range from 1 to 7. <font color="red"><b>color</b> attribute will obviously change font color if equated to 
various combinations of RGB values.</font> 
        </p>
         <p>
            This apart if the background color has of the document has to be varied then, 
the <b>bgColor</b> attribute of the <b><i>body</i></b> tag can be set or the entire text can be aligned using the <b>align</b> attribute. 
Indentation with the help of the “paragraph tags” or a new line character with a line break can be achieved. Some 
special characters like copyright i.e. &copy; or registered trademark i.e &reg;.     that are not the part of a standard keyboard 
can be inserted using the HTML character set. Apart from it, if the &lt;&&gt; signs are to displayed on the browser then 
corresponding character set equivalent has to be chosen. Text alignment can be either left / center / right; this can 
be done using the div container tag that has the align attribute. You can set the alignment accordingly. 
         </p>

         <p>
            The power of 
net lies in its capacity to link various web pages scattered over different places on the net. The web pages can be 
anchored to each other using the <b><i>a href</i></b> tags.
<br>
  For instance &lt;A HREF = <a href="http://www.anuda.com/index.html">http://www.anuda.com/index.html</a>  &gt;Click here 
&lt;/A&gt; will link to the website referenced by HREF. The user interface becomes better looking if images are included 
using the img tag. Its attributes <b>src, height, width, align, border</b> etc will produce corresponding effects. Images can 
be made clickable if the img tag is contained within the anchor tags as demonstrated.
         </p>

         <p>
            <b>
                An image is to be inserted 
exactly at the bottom at the center position, should be square in shape with a border & should display a text when 
the mouse moves over it. Another clickable image that will lead to a different HTML page should also be inserted at 
the topmost portion of the web page, it should be wide enough to fit almost 75% of the page <sup>,</sup>s center. 
            </b>
